This is a test file to verify the sounds directory is working.

To add your woosh sound:
1. Copy your woosh sound file from C:\Program Files (x86)\Boxing-timer-sound
2. Paste it in this directory (public/sounds/)
3. Rename it to one of these:
   - start.mp3 (for round start)
   - bell.mp3 (for round end)
   - warning.mp3 (for 10-second warning)

The file should be an audio format like .mp3, .wav, or .ogg
